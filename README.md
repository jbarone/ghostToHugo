**ghostToHugo** is a utility project that was created the allow the conversion
of an export from the Ghost blogging engine into the Hugo engine.

## Installing

There are 2 options for installation.

### Pre-Built Binaries

With every new versioned release. Binaries are built for most major platforms.
You can simply download the one for your operating system from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo/releases/latest). Unzip
the package and place it somewhere in your path, and you are ready to go.

### Building the Latest and Greatest

The project is written in Go, and currently will require building from source.
Make sure you have Go installed and configured, then just run:

```
go get -u github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo
```

this will download, compile, and install `ghostToHugo`

## Using

```
Usage: ghostToHugo [OPTIONS] <Ghost Export>
  -f, --dateformat string   Date format string to use for time conversions (default: RFC3339)
  -p, --hugo string         Path to hugo project (default ".")
  -l, --location string     Location to use for time conversions (default: local)
```

At a minimum you need to specify the path to the exported Ghost json file.

NOTES: 

- The `dateformat` string must be provided in Go's specific time format string. Reference [here](https://gobyexample.com/time-formatting-parsing)
- The `location` string should be a value that matches the IANA Time Zone database, such as "America/New_York"

```

```
$ ghostToHugo --hugo ~/mysite export.json
$ ghostToHugo -p ~/mysite export.json
```

```
$ ghostToHugo --dateformat "2006-01-02 15:04:05" export.json
$ ghostToHugo -f "2006-01-02 15:04:05" export.json
```

```
$ ghostToHugo --location "America/Chicago" export.json
$ ghostToHugo -l "America/Chicago" export.json
```
